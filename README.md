## Projects

### ML Pipeline in Production

This project focuses on preparing machine learning models for production environments. It includes:

- **Performance Testing and Preparing for Production**: Techniques for testing model performance and readiness for deployment.
- **Data and Model Versioning**: Strategies for versioning datasets and models to ensure reproducibility.
- **CI/CD**: Implementation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for machine learning models.
- **API Deployment**: Methods for deploying models as APIs to facilitate integration with other systems.

### ML Model Monitoring

This project delves into the critical aspects of monitoring machine learning models in production to maintain their performance and reliability. It encompasses:

- **Model Training and Deployment**: Covers the initial steps of training machine learning models and deploying them into a production environment. This phase sets the foundation for subsequent monitoring activities.

- **Model Scoring and Detecting Model Drift**: Focuses on the evaluation of model performance over time by scoring incoming data and identifying any deviations or drifts in model behavior. Detecting model drift is essential to ensure that the model continues to perform as expected when exposed to new data. citeturn0search2

- **Diagnosing and Fixing Problems**: Addresses the methodologies for diagnosing issues that arise in production models, such as performance degradation or unexpected predictions, and outlines strategies for rectifying these problems to restore optimal functionality. citeturn0search0

- **Model Reporting and Monitoring**: Emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and reporting of model performance metrics. This includes setting up dashboards and alerts to proactively manage and maintain model health in a production setting. citeturn0search6

### Predict Customer Churn

An end-to-end project aimed at predicting customer churn. This project demonstrates the application of MLOps practices in a real-world scenario, including data preprocessing, model training, deployment, and monitoring.

### Reproducible Model Workflow

This project emphasizes the creation of reproducible machine learning workflows, highlighting the importance of consistency and reliability in model development. It includes:

- **MLOps Pipeline**: Establishes a structured pipeline that integrates various stages of the machine learning workflow, ensuring seamless transitions and reproducibility across processes.

- **Data Exploration and Preparation**: Involves systematic exploration and preprocessing of data to ensure that datasets are clean, well-understood, and ready for modeling. This step is crucial for achieving reproducible results.

- **Data Validation**: Implements rigorous validation techniques to verify the integrity and quality of data before it is used in model training, thereby preventing issues that could compromise reproducibility.

- **Training, Validation, and Experiment Tracking**: Focuses on the systematic training and validation of models while meticulously tracking experiments. This practice ensures that model development is transparent, and results can be consistently replicated. citeturn0search3

- **Final Pipeline Release and Deployment**: Covers the steps necessary to finalize the machine learning pipeline and deploy it into a production environment, ensuring that the deployed models are reproducible and maintainable.
