# Tutorial: Diagnose and fix operational problems in a deployed model



## Diagonsing and Fixing Operational Problems

### How to diagnose and fix problems in a production deployed code?

To understand a model's functionality and find its underlying problems, we need to take care of the following things:

- Periodic training
  - Figure out an optimal retraining strategy.
- Monitor model performance
- Analyse
  - Clear visibility of the model helps us and guides the model performance.

### Summary

In this section we will diagnose and fix problems in a production deployed code. To that end, we will:

- Use **evidently** and **mlflow** libraries.
- Deploy a machine learning model in **Heroku**.
- Calculate data drift for the model.
- Use **mlflow Tracking** for the training experiments indicating data drift.
- Explore the results using **mlflow UI**.

### Tutorial: Data Drift / mlflow

In this tutorial we will use the [Bike Sharing Dataset(opens in a new tab)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00275/Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip).

You can use the following code snippet (from `train.py`) to analyze this data before starting this tutorial.

`content = requests.get("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00275/Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip").content with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(content)) as arc:     raw_data = pd.read_csv(arc.open("day.csv"), header=0, sep=',', parse_dates=['dteday'], index_col='dteday') ## observe data structure raw_data.tail()`

### Environment setup

##### Prerequisites

- Heroku account

- GitHub account

- Clone the Github repo
  
  `https://github.com/udacity/cd0583-diagnose-and-fix.git`

##### Dependencies

- All the dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can setup a virtual environment using [Anaconda(opens in a new tab)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and install the required dependencies there.
- `runtime.txt` contains the python version that is used for this tutorial.

### Steps

Follow the steps below for deploying this model:

- Ensure that all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file are installed.

- Run the `train.py` file to log experiments in **mlflow**  

- View and analyse the results shown in the **mlflow webui**  

### How to fix Data Drift issues

- If there is substantial data drift then you should reweigh samples in the training data, giving more importance to newer patterns.
- Identify new segments where the model fails, and create a different model for it. Consider using an ensemble of several models for different segments of the data.
- Change the prediction target. For example, switch from weekly to daily forecast or replace the regression model with classification into categories from "high" to "low."
- Pick a different model architecture to account for ongoing drift. You can consider incremental or online learning, where the model continuously adapts to new data.
- Apply domain adaptation strategies. There are a number of approaches to help the model better generalize to a new target domain.
