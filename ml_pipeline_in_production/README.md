## Lesson 1: Introduction to Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production
This is the lesson you're in right now! In this lesson, we introduce you to:

- The big picture â€“ what is this course about and why does it matter?
- The project you'll build at the end of the course.
- The prerequisites you'll need to have before you take this course.
- The business stakeholders you'll interact with as a professional in this field.
- The tools and environment you'll need for the course.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have context on what this course is about and what you'll need to have to succeed in the course.

## Lesson 2: Performance Testing and Preparing a Model for Production
In this lesson we'll learn:

- How to finalize preparing a model for production by analyzing performance on slices.
- Some of the different types of bias and how to probe a model for bias using Aequitas.
- Write a model card which encapsulates the purpose, provenance, and pitfalls of your model.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to thoroughly audit and document a model before deploying it into production.

## Lesson 3: Data and Model Versioning
In this lesson we'll learn:

- How to version control data and models using Data Version Control (DVC).
- Set up and connect remote storage with DVC.
- Create pipelines and track experiments using DVC.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to use all the core functionality of DVC which, despite the name, includes both version controlling data and models, but also creating reproducible pipelines and experimentation frameworks.

## Lesson 4: CI/CD
In this lesson we'll learn:

- A few key software engineering principles including automating, testing, and versioning.
- How to use GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI).
- How to use Heroku for app hosting and Continuous Deployment (CD).

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to set up the entire infrastructure necessary to create a robust web app including CI/CD.

## Lesson 5: API Deployment with FastAPI
In this lesson we'll learn:

- How to write an API using FastAPI including path, query, and body parameters.
- The principles behind Heroku and how to deploy an API using both the CLI and the GUI.
- How to test the live app using the requests module.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write and deploy an API to Heroku and test it both locally and in production.

## What You'll Build

At the end of the course you will build your very own API using FastAPI and deploy it using Heroku. The API will run machine learning inference, in this case a prediction on the Census Income Data Set. In the process of building this model and API you will check performance on slices, write a model card, track your data and models using DVC, and use GitHub Actions and Heroku for CI/CD.

The project on its own can stand as a portfolio piece since it leverages so many different technologies. Additionally, the various technologies can easily be incorporated into other projects be it portfolio, school, or work projects. These tools and techniques are versatile.
